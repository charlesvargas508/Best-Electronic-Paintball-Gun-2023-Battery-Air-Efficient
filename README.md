# Best-Electronic-Paintball-Gun-2023-Battery-Air-Efficient
The best electronic paintball gun is one that shoots smoothly with flawless accuracy, and that fires with incredible speed. That should be air and battery efficient as well.  Compared to mechanical markers, the electronic markers have soft triggers, don’t need cocking before firing, quieter, don’t kick much, and are used in tournaments.  To be very honest, picking the best electronic paintball gun over a mechanical is a no-brainer for seasoned players. I have all sorts of markers, including pumps, but I always opt for electronic versions for more serious tournaments because those are more accurate, speedy, and reliable.
